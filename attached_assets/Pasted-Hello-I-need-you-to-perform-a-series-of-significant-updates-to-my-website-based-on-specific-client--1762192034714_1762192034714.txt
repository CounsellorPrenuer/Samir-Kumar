Hello! I need you to perform a series of significant updates to my website based on specific client feedback. Please analyze my existing code (HTML, CSS, and JS) and apply the following changes across the entire project.

Here is the list of tasks:

1. Adjust Section Layout and Width

    Task: Modify the global CSS. Find the main content sections or containers (e.g., elements with class .container, or direct <section> tags).

    Change: Apply a max-width to these containers (e.g., max-width: 1200px; or max-width: 80vw;) and center them using margin: 0 auto;. This will reduce the width on large screens, making the content appear more elegant and focused.

2. Standardize Paragraph Text Alignment

    Task: In the global CSS file, create or modify the rule for all paragraph tags (<p>).

    Change: Set the text alignment to text-align: left;. This will ensure all body text is consistently left-aligned for maximum readability, as requested.

3. Improve Text Contrast and Sharpness

    Task: In the global CSS file, find the style rule for the main body text (e.g., body, p).

    Change: The client feels the text is "feeble or dull." Change the color property to a darker shade. If it's currently a light gray (like #777), update it to a much darker one (like #333 or #212529) to improve contrast against the background.

4. Add Images to Key Sections

    Task: Generate three high-quality, professional images.

    Placement:

        Image 1: Find the HTML section titled "Advanced psychometric" and insert a relevant image (e.g., an abstract image representing "mind," "analytics," or "personal growth").

        Image 2: Find the HTML section titled "Professional development" and insert a relevant image (e.g., a modern office, a person climbing stairs, a graph).

        Image 3: Find the HTML section titled "Ready to transform" and insert a relevant image (e.g., a 'before and after' concept, a butterfly, a sunrise).

    Note: Ensure all new images are responsive (e.g., max-width: 100%;).

5. Update "Our Career Solution" Section

    Task: Find the HTML for the "Our Career Solution" section.

    Change: Add a new sub-section or content block to "introduce a package." This new block should include:

        A small, relevant generated image.

        A new heading (e.g., <h3>Featured Package</h3>).

        A short paragraph of descriptive placeholder text (e.g., "Discover our comprehensive solution designed for...").

6. Enhance "Success Stories" (Testimonials)

    Task: Find the HTML for the "Success Stories" section.

    Change: Add 2-3 new testimonial blocks. You can duplicate the existing testimonial HTML structure.

    Content:

        Use placeholder text for the new testimonials (e.g., "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...").

        Generate 2-3 professional-looking, "authentic" placeholder avatar images (e.g., simple head-and-shoulders silhouettes or generic faces) and add them to these new testimonials.

7. Update Resources/Blogs Layout

    Task: Modify the HTML/CSS for the blog list page and the individual blog post template.

    Change: Update the design to include a "featured image" or "graphic" for every article. Add a placeholder <img> tag to the template so an image can be easily added to each post.

8. Expand Photo Gallery

    Task: Find the HTML for the "Photo gallery."

    Change: Add 3-4 new placeholder images to the gallery. You can generate these or use stock images that fit the theme of the website (e.g., students, professionals, office environments).

9, 10, & 11. Implement SEO & Marketing Review (Crucial Task) This is a combined task to review and optimize the site's code and content for marketing and SEO, with a specific focus on "Faridabad."

    A. Technical SEO (Code):

        Title Tag: Update the homepage's <title> tag to be: [Client's Business Name] | Expert Career Guidance in Faridabad.

        Meta Description: Write a new <meta name="description"> for the homepage (around 150 characters) that includes the keywords "career guidance" and "Faridabad" naturally.

        Alt Text: Scan all <img> tags on the website. Add descriptive alt text to any images that are missing it.

        Heading Structure: Review the homepage to ensure it has a logical heading structure (a single <h1>, followed by <h2>, <h3>, etc.).

    B. Local SEO (Content):

        Homepage Copy: Find the main introduction or "About" text on the homepage. Modify a sentence to naturally include the local keyword. (e.g., "We provide premier career guidance services for students and professionals in Faridabad.").

        Footer/Contact: Ensure the business address (if available) includes "Faridabad."

    C. Marketing Review (Content):

        Calls-to-Action (CTAs): Find 1-2 key buttons (e.g., "Learn More," "Contact Us"). Suggest and implement stronger, more impactful text (e.g., "Start Your Career Path," "Get Your Free Consultation").

        Headlines: Review the main headline (<h1>) on the homepage. Ensure it clearly states the value proposition (e.g., "Transform Your Future with Expert Career Guidance").
